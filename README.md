# HTML-Generator
As a manager, I want to have a convenient application that dynamically generates a HTML file displaying information about my engineering team so that I can have quick access to their basic information.

So I've created a CLI application that takes information about employees and automatically generates a HTML page based on submitted data.

This application is also subject to Jest unit testing to ensure that all components function as intended according to the given criteria.
