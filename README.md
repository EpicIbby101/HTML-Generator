# HTML-Generator
As a manager, I want to have a convenient application that dynamically generates a HTML file displaying information about my engineering team so that I can have quick access to their basic information.

So I've created a CLI application that takes information about employees and automatically generates a HTML page based on submitted data.

This application is also subject to Jest unit testing to ensure that all components function as intended according to the given criteria.

## Features
- Streamlined and simple CLI application
- Menued application structure
- Automatically generates a styled HTML file

## Installation
- Clone this repository
- Install module dependencies using 'npm install'
- In the root directory run 'node index.js' to run the application
- A HTML file will be generated in the output folder, a folder will be created if one isn't present
- Open the HTML file in your browser to see the generated page
